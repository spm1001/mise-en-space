Port to pure function to validate architecture.","design":"## Why sheets.py First\n\n- 138 lines, single function `read_sheets_as_csv()`\n- Clear input → output\n- If this works, docs.py/slides.py/gmail.py follow same pattern\n\n## Porting Steps\n\n1. Copy extraction logic from v1 tools/sheets.py\n2. Remove `get_sheets_service()` call\n3. Change signature: `extract_sheets_csv(sheets_response: dict) -\u003e str`\n4. Write unit test with fixture\n5. Write integration test with real sheet\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] extractors/sheets.py exists\n- [ ] Pure function signature\n- [ ] Unit test passes\n- [ ] Integration test passes","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"spm1001@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T22:10:34.217867Z","created_by":"spm1001","updated_at":"2026-01-20T22:10:34.217867Z"}
